Here are some old installation instructions.

### Ubuntu 12.04/14.04/16.04 Debian 7

To compile:

```shell
apt-get install cmake gcc g++ gfortran liblapack-dev swig python-dev python-numpy
```

Optional (ubuntu 17.04 only):
```shell
apt-get install libhdf5-dev hdf5-tools
```

To be able to use function `pre.rigidPolyhedron()` over large polyhedron,
we recommand to install scipy:
```shell
apt-get install python-scipy
```


To visualize:

```shell
apt-get install python-vtk paraview
```

To build the documentation:

```shell
apt-get install doxygen graphviz python-numpydoc texlive-latex-extra dvipng imagemagick
```

To read tutorials

```shell
apt-get install python-pip
pip install jupyter
```

### OpenSuse Leap-15

At the very least to build, the list of package to install is
```shell
sudo zypper install cmake gcc gcc-c++ gcc-fortran lapack-devel swig python3-devel
```

Then the optional packages to use HDF5 library are
```shell
sudo zypper install zlib-devel hdf5-devel
```

To build the documentation
```shell
sudo zypper install doxygen graphviz texlive-dvipng ImageMagick
```

To visualize:
```shell
sudo zypper install paraview
```

### OpenSuse Leap 42.1

To compile:

```shell
zypper install cmake gcc gcc-c++ gcc-fortran lapack-devel swig python-devel python-numpy-devel
```

Optional:
```shell
zypper install zlib-devel hdf5-devel
```

To be able to use function `pre.rigidPolyhedron()` over large polyhedron,
we recommand to install scipy:
```shell
zypper install python-scipy
```

To visualize:

```shell
zypper install python-vtk paraview
```

Due to some problem one must add to the *.bashrc* file a line similar to:

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/mpi/gcc/openmpi/lib64
```

To build the documentation:

```shell
zypper install doxygen graphviz python-numpydoc texlive-dvipng ImageMagick
```

To read tutorials

```shell
zypper install python-pip
pip install jupyter
```

### CentOS 7

To compile:

```shell
yum install git cmake gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran lapack-devel swig python-devel numpy
```

Optional:
As HDF5 library is not provided by standard repository, an extra repository
must be added before installing dependencies:

```shell
yum install epel-release
yum install hdf5-devel
```

To be able to use function `pre.rigidPolyhedron()` over large polyhedron,
we recommand to install scipy:
```shell
yum install scipy
```

To visualize, some extra packages, not provided by the standard package repository, are
needed. Thus an extra repository must be added before installing the dependencies:

```shell
yum install epel-release
yum install vtk-python paraview
```

To build the documentation:

```shell
yum install doxygen graphviz tex-preview textlive-latex texlive-dvipng python-sphinx python-numpydoc ImageMagick
```

To read tutorials

```shell
yum install python-pip
pip install jupyter
```


### Mac OS

On MacOs using macports

To compile:
```shell
port install gcc7 python27 py27-numpy swig-python cmake
```

Then you need to set the compiler and python as the default on your system:

```shell
sudo port select gcc mp-gcc7
sudo port select python python27
```
_Note: here gcc7 stands for version 7,but any version from gcc4.5 to gcc7 should work_

Optional:
```shell
port install hdf5 +fortran
```

To be able to use function `pre.rigidPolyhedron()` over large polyhedron,
we recommand to install scipy:
```shell
port install py27-scipy
```

To visualize:

```shell
port install vtk +python27
```

To build the documentation:

```shell
doxygen graphviz py27-sphinx py27-numpydoc texlive-latex-extra dvipng ImageMagick
```

To read tutorials:

```shell
sudo port install py27-jupyter
```
