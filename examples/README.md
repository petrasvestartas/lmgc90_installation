In order to run an example:

 Make sure that python knows where you compiled LMGC90.
 Usually it is done with an environment variable :

 $> export PYTHONPATH=absolute_path_to_your_build_directory

 
 * Then go to the folder of your example:
   For example: cd RIGID_2D/1024DK_BoxJC

 * If there is a case generation script run it:
   For example: python gen_sample.py

 * Run the computation with python command script
   For example: python command.py

 * Watch the graphic results using paraview

 * Now read the manuals please !
