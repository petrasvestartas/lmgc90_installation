This directory aims at test pre_lmgc polyhedra genration functions.

With visuAvatars function one can quickly check sanity of the generated polyhedra,
in this case the geometries are written in DATBOX and loaded in LMGC90 to check
that they are really usable.

TODO: 
 - Test 'vertices' generation method with non-convex points set.

regular_lots.py : Use 'regular' generation method.
                  Put the generated bodies in a cubic box (deposited on a cubic lattice).
                  Generate one avatar for a fixed number of vertices.
                  The number of vertices varies from 'min_vert' to 'max_vert'.
                  Half of them have a boundary radius of 1. the other half of 'rad'
TODO : check if the polyhedron generated already exists and get rid of it in this case.



random_lots.py : Use 'random' generation method.
                 Put the generated bodies in a cubic box (deposited on a cubic lattice).
                 Generate 'nb_each' avatars for a fixed number of vertices.
                 The number of vertices varies from 'min_vert' to 'max_vert'.
                 Half of the polyhedron have a boundary radius of 1. the other half of 'rad'.
TODO : give a tolerance to generate points not too close from others.
