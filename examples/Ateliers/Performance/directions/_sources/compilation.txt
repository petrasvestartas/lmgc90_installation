Compilation
===========

The compilation process can be roughly described as a translation step between the
source files, which are written in a (geek) human understandable way, to a binary
format executable by the computer.

This compilation step is done by a *compiler*. LMGC90 being written in Fortran language,
a Fortran compiler is needed. Currently the supported compilers are:

* gfortran: GNU fortran compiler (free)
* ifort: Intel fortran compiler
* pgf90: Portland fortran compiler

The aim of this part is to show the influence of the compiler and the options of compilation
on the computation time.
