   timer
   compilation
   parallel
   linear_algebra_solver

This document aims at giving to the users the keys to use LMGC90 software in the most
efficient way. The speed computation can be improved throught three independent different
steps: the compilation process, the parameters or functions used in the simulation script
or by using parallel computation.
